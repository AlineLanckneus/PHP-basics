# Title: OOP Pricecalculator challenge

- Repository: `oop-pricecalculator`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning challenge`
- Duration: `5 days`
- Deployment strategy : `Heroku`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning objectives
- Apply basic OOP principles
- Learn to use an MVC
- Import data using json

## The Mission
Make a price calculator with the following entities:
- Customer (Email)
- A customer group (Name)
- A product (product name, description, price)

In this directory you can find 3 JSON files, you can import the data from here.

A customer belongs to a customer group, which can also belong to another group (infinite).
You don't need to worry for infinite loops in this exercise.

Both a customer and a group can have a discount, which can be a percentage or a fixed amount. 

To calculate the price:
- For the customer group: In case of variable discounts look for highest discount of all the groups the user has.
- If some groups have fixed discounts, count them all up.
- Look which discount (fixed or variable) will give the customer the most value.
- Now look at the discount of the customer.
- First subtract fixed amounts, then percentages!
- A price can never be negative.

### What is an MVC?
MVC is a classic web design pattern consistant of three levels, and is an extension of the principle of **seperation of concerns**:

- The **Controller** responds to user actions and invokes changes on the model or view as appropriate.
- The **Model** represents the information on which the application operates--its business logic.
- The **View** renders the model into a web page suitable for interaction with the user.

For now you should create 3 different directories:
- **Controller/**: has access to GET/POST vars, receives the Request
- **Model/**: Most of your code should be here, for example the Product and Customer class.
- **View/**: Your HTML files.

While splitting up the Controller & Model is quite intuitive, splitting up the View from the Controller might require a larger change in how you write code. Let us look at some example:

````php
<?php
//oldcode.php
if($_GET['age'] > 18) {
    echo '<h1>You are an adult!</h1>';
} else {
    echo '<h1>You are a child!</h1>';
}
````

We can split this up into two files:
````php
<?php
//view.php
$sentence = ($_GET['age'] > 18) ? 'You are an adult!' : 'You are a child!';
require 'view.php';
````

````php
<!-- view.php-->
<h1><?php echo $sentence?></h1>
````

## Must-have features
- A dropdown where you can select a Product and a Customer and you get the basic information of the product + the price.
- A category page
- Use a [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
- Use separate objects for importing the entities with JSON, and for managing the entities.

## Nice to have features
- An actual login page for a customer
- A table where you can see in detail how the price is calculated
- The possibility to have different prices for different quantities (eg: 1 EUR per item for 1, 0.9 EUR per item for 100, ...)

### Discussion for friday
- Do you prefer procedural code or object oriented one? Why?
- What is the use of an MVC? Do you prefer another way of structuring your code?
